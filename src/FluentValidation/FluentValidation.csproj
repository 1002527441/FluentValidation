Changes in 9.0.0:

* Equal/NotEqual now perform ordinal comparison when used with string properties
* Severity can now be set dynamically with a callback
* Removed WithLocalizedMessage (WithMessage that takes a callback is the replacement)
* Removed ResourceName from ValidationFailure
* Removed ResourceName and ResourceType from IStringSource.
* Removed SetCollectionValidator which was deprecated in 8.0 
* Removed DelegatingValidator which was deprecated in 8.x.
* Additional overload of OnAnyFailure that can receive a collection of validation failures
* Remove DisplayAttribute integration and reference to DataAnnotations.
* ComparisonProperty placeholder is now formatted like PropertyName
* Translations of default error messages into other languages are now lazily-loaded
* PropertyValidator.ShouldValidateAsync reanamed to ShouldValidateAsynchronously to remove confusion where the naming suggested this was an async method
* PropertyValidatorContext.Instance renamed to InstanceToValidate for consistency with ValidationContext.
* Removed various methods from MessageFormatter that were deprecated in 8.x
